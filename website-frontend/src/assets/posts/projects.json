    "description": "Read Alignment is the bottleneck stage of DNA Analysis. Furthermore, read alignment programs that use a multireference genome, to reduce bias and increase accuracy, are dramatically slower again. BWBBLE, the read alignment program I focused on, is 100 times slower. My project successfully demonstrated that a linear speedup in BWBBLE is possible by parallelizing the read alignment stage using Kubernetes jobs. We also demonstrated that it was possible to achieve this cheaply and with minimal operational overhead using a custom built Kubernetes Controller. In doing so, we have made it possible for more researchers to easily leverage BWBBLE for their work. ",
